        <p>Oh, you're a <strong>dollar naughtier</strong> than most. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. I don't want to be rescued. Hello Morbo, how's the family? Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!</p>

        <p>You know, I was God once. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! I never loved you. And so we say <a href="#">goodbye</a> to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. Fatal.</p>

        <li>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared&hellip;</li>
        <li>Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</li>
        <li>
            Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?

        <h3>Bend Her</h3>
        <p>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be&hellip; I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared&hellip; One hundred dollars.</p>
        <p>Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! It doesn't look so shiny to me. We're also Santa Claus! You know, I was God once.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.</li>
        <li>One hundred dollars.</li>
        <li>Hey, guess what you're accessories to.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>The Cryonic Woman</h5>
        <p>You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!</p>
        <h6>Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV</h6>
        <p>Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Bender, you risked your life to save me! Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?</p>
        <p>Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine.  He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. It must be wonderful.</p>
        <p>Say it in Russian! Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Professor, make a woman out of me.</p>
        <p>One hundred dollars. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack!  I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Bender, we're trying our best. I love you, buddy! Guess again.</p>
        <p>You're going to do his laundry? Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. That's not soon enough! Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.</p>
        <p>Eeeee!  Now say "nuclear wessels"! A true inspiration for the children. Shut up and take my money!</p>
        <p>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared&hellip; You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? No, I'm Santa Claus! The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</p>
        <p>Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.</p>
        <p>Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? You don't know how to do any of those. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Really?!</p>
        <p>Goodbye, friends.  I never thought I'd die like this.  But I always really hoped. Who are those horrible orange men? Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? She also liked to shut up! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!</p>
        <p>Who are you, my warranty?! Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? I'm a thing. Ooh, name it after me!</p>
